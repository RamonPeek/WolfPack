# Wolfpack
Internship assignment for Wolfpack.

## QuickStart
Important note: To build this app using the IntelliJ IDE, Java SDK 11 is required.

#### Starting the API
1. Load the project into IntelliJ.
2. In the project-overview navigate to src/main/java/nl/ramonpeek/Application.java.
3. Right-click on Application.java and select Run 'Application.main()'.

Once the API is booted successfully, it will print a link to the Swagger UI in the output. If the output is not visible, it is also possible to access Swagger via: [Localhost](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/).

#### Starting the tests
1. Load the project into IntelliJ.
2. In the project-overview navigate to src/test/nl/ramonpeek/tests.
3. Right-click on the test-package and select Run 'Tests in 'nl.ramonpeek.tests''.

IntelliJ should show a box which contains all tests, and whether they failed or passed.
